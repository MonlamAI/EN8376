✦ The Journey ✦
In the underground station.
A crowding among placards
in a staring dead light.

The train arrived and collected
faces and portfolios.

Darkness next. We sat
in the carriages like statues,
hauled through the caverns.
Restraint, dreams, restraint.

In stations under sea level
they sold the news of the dark.
People in motion sadly
silently under the clock dials.

The train carried
outer garments and souls.

Glances in all directions
on the journey through the mountain.
Still no change.

But nearer the surface a murmuring
of bees began---freedom.
We stepped out of the earth.

The land beat its wings
once and became still
under us, widespread and green.
Ears of corn blew in
over the platforms.

Terminus---I
followed on, further.
How many were with me? Four,
five, hardly more.

Houses, roads, skies,
blue inlets, mountains
opened their windows.
